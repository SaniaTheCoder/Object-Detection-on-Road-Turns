# Object-Detection-on-Road-Turns
This project uses deep learning models like YOLO and Faster R-CNN for object detection on road turns. It identifies road signs, vehicles, pedestrians, and other obstacles to aid autonomous navigation and driver assistance systems. The goal is to enhance safety and accuracy in turn detection and road environment analysis.
